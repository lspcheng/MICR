Updated .py script with useVersion command

Updated .csv files with: 
- the actual concatenated name of the new sound files
- the actual 1-8 trigger numbers
- moving Trigger column to replace diphDur which wasn't being used so that 
the script would be using the correct [-1] column for the randomization/shuffling

** Still need to update the placeholder soundfiles with the final versions that are
matched for pitch and duration
